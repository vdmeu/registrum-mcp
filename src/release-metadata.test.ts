/**
 * Declared dependency floors, not just the lockfile (#14, #7).

 * The MCP Marketplace scanner reads `package.json` from the GitHub repo and

 * `README.md`, `package.json` and `src/*.ts` as scanned_files - no
 * `package-lock.json`. With no lockfile it can only assume the lowest version a
 * range admits, so `"vitest": "^3"` reads to it as vitest 3.0.0.
 *
 * That is why the 2026-08-08 audit (a68d675) only half-worked. `npm audit fix`
 * moved the *lockfile* to vitest 3.2.7 and `npm audit` has reported 0
 * vulnerabilities ever since - but the declared range stayed `^3`, whose floor
 * of 3.0.0 is still inside both advisories. esbuild cleared in the same commit
 * precisely because its range was bumped explicitly to `^0.28.1`, putting its
 * floor on the patched version. Result: the public listing kept showing 2
 * critical vitest findings, and the score stuck at 5.2 "Moderate Risk".
 *
 * So the floor a range admits is a published trust signal in its own right.
 * Loosening one of these back to a bare major silently re-opens the finding.
