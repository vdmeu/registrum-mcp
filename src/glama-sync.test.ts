 * When sync.mjs cannot find "Sync Server" it used to report two possible
 * causes at once - "either the session expired or Glama changed the UI" -
 * and leave the reader to open a screenshot and decide. On 2026-08-31 the
 * page it had actually landed on was a plain sign-in wall ("You need to sign
 * in to access this page"), which the script could have read directly.
 *
 * A diagnostic that lists both causes is one the next person has to
 * re-diagnose by hand, which is exactly the manual walkthrough this tooling
 * exists to remove. The page itself says which one it is; read it.
